Summary: A finite volume partial differential equation solver using Python

Development: https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy

Documentation: http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy

FiPy is an object oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver,
written in Python, based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach. The
framework has been developed in the Materials Science and Engineering
Division (MSED) and Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials
Science (CTCMS), in the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The solution of
coupled sets of PDEs is ubiquitous to the numerical simulation of
science problems.
|
Numerous PDE solvers exist, using a variety of languages and numerical
approaches. Many are proprietary, expensive and difficult to customize.
As a result, scientists spend considerable resources repeatedly
developing limited tools for specific problems. Our approach, combining
the FV method and Python, provides a tool that is extensible, powerful
and freely available. A significant advantage to Python is the existing
suite of tools for array calculations, sparse matrices and data
rendering.
|
The FiPy framework includes terms for transient diffusion, convection
and standard sources, enabling the solution of arbitrary combinations
of coupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs. Currently
implemented models include phase field treatments of polycrystalline,
dendritic, and electrochemical phase transformations as well as a level
set treatment of the electrodeposition process.

Installing fipy
===============

Installing `fipy` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `fipy` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda install fipy
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba install fipy
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `fipy` available on your platform with `conda`:

```
conda search fipy --channel conda-forge
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba search fipy --channel conda-forge
```

Alternatively, `mamba repoquery` may provide more information:

```
# Search all versions available on your platform:
mamba repoquery search fipy --channel conda-forge

# List packages depending on `fipy`:
mamba repoquery whoneeds fipy --channel conda-forge

# List dependencies of `fipy`:
mamba repoquery depends fipy --channel conda-forge
```


About conda-forge
=================

conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable packages.
In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has been automated into the
conda-forge GitHub organization. The conda-forge organization contains one repository
for each of the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a *feedstock*.

A feedstock is made up of a conda recipe (the instructions on what and how to build
the package) and the necessary configurations for automatic building using freely
available continuous integration services. Thanks to the awesome service provided by
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [GitHub](https://github.com/),
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/),
[Drone](https://cloud.drone.io/welcome), and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/)
it is possible to build and upload installable packages to the
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/)
channel for Linux, Windows and OSX respectively.

To manage the continuous integration and simplify feedstock maintenance
[conda-smithy](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy) has been developed.
Using the ``conda-forge.yml`` within this repository, it is possible to re-render all of
this feedstock's supporting files (e.g. the CI configuration files) with ``conda smithy rerender``.

For more information please check the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/).

Terminology
===========

**feedstock** - the conda recipe (raw material), supporting scripts and CI configuration.

**conda-smithy** - the tool which helps orchestrate the feedstock.
                   Its primary use is in the construction of the CI ``.yml`` files
                   and simplify the management of *many* feedstocks.

**conda-forge** - the place where the feedstock and smithy live and work to
                  produce the finished article (built conda distributions)


Updating fipy-feedstock
=======================

If you would like to improve the fipy recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/fipy-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
